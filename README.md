**Here are the steps that must be performed before running the R script:**

1. The script downloads data from web, if it doesn't see the folder from zip file in working directory

**If you want to download data yourself make sure to put folder inside the script in working directory, you can run the R script ([run_analysis.R](run_analysis.R)).** Note that it requires the [reshape2 package](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/reshape2/index.html), which can be downloaded from CRAN.

**The output of the R script is a tidy data set**

You can read more about the data and the analysis in the [code book](CodeBook.md).
