**Here are the steps that must be performed before running the R script:**

1. The script downloads data from web, if it doesn't see the folder from zip file in working directory
2. 'plyr' package should be downloaded

**If you want to download data yourself make sure to put folder inside the script in working directory, otherwise you can run the R script ([run_analysis.R](run_analysis.R)).

**The output of the R script is a tidy data set**

You can read more about the data and the analysis in the [code book](CodeBook.md).
